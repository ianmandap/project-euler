# Problem Statement
# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, 
# tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position 
# and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for 
# SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall 
# call the word a triangle word.

# Using words.txt, a text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, 
# how many are triangle words?
